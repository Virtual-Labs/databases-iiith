<div id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p>Second normal form (2NF) was originally defined by E.F. Codd in 1971. A table that is in first normal form (1NF) must meet additional criteria if it is to qualify for second normal form. Specifically: a 1NF table is in 2NF if and only if, given any candidate key <i>K</i> and any attribute <i>A</i> that is not a constituent of a candidate key, <i>A</i> depends upon the whole of <i>K</i> rather than just a part of it.</p>

<p>In slightly more formal terms: a 1NF table is in 2NF if and only if all its non-prime attributes are functionally dependent on the whole of every candidate key. (A non-prime attribute is one that does not belong to any candidate key.)</p>
</div>

<div id="theory">
<h2>Theory</h2>

<p>The general requirements of 2NF:</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove subsets of data that apply to multiple rows of a table and place them in separate tables.</li>
<li>Create relationships between these new tables and their predecessors through the use of foreign keys.</li>
</ol>

<p>These rules can be summarized in a simple statement: 2NF attempts to reduce the amount of redundant data in a table by extracting it, placing it in new table(s) and creating relationships between those tables. Let's look at an example. Imagine an online store that maintains customer information in a database. They might have a single table called Customers with the following elements:</p>

<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>CustNum</th>
<th>FirstName</th>
<th>LastName</th>
<th>Address</th>
<th>City</th>
<th>State</th>
<th>PINCODE</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>...</td>
<td>...</td>
<td>...</td>
<td>...</td>
<td>...</td>
<td>...</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>A brief look at this table reveals a small amount of redundant data. We're storing the city, state and PINCODE entries multiple times as they can repeat. Now, that might not seem like too much added storage in our simple example, but imagine the wasted space if we had millions of rows in our table. Additionally, if the PINCODE code for a place were to change, we'd need to make that change in many places throughout the database.</p>

<p>In a 2NF-compliant database structure, this redundant information is extracted and stored in a separate table. Our new table (let's call it PINCODEs) might have the following fields:</p>

<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>PINCODE</th>
<th>City</th>
<th>State</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>...</td>
<td>...</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If we want to be super-efficient, we can even fill this table in advance -- the post office provides a directory of all valid PINCODE codes and their city/state relationships. Surely, you've encountered a situation where this type of database was utilized. Someone taking an order might have asked you for your PINCODE code first and then knew the city and state you were calling from. This type of arrangement reduces operator error and increases efficiency.</p>

<p>Now that we've removed the duplicative data from the Customers table, we've satisfied the first rule of second normal form. We still need to use a foreign key to tie the two tables together. We'll use the PINCODE code (the primary key from the PINCODEs table) to create that relationship. Here's our new Customers table:</p>

<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>CustNum</th>
<th>FirstName</th>
<th>LastName</th>
<th>Address</th>
<th>PINCODE</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>...</td>
<td>...</td>
<td>...</td>
<td>...</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>We've now minimized the amount of redundant information stored within the database and our structure is in second normal form!</p>

<h2>Procedure</h2>
Kindly refer to the common <a href="../../pub/23/">procedure</a> page for details of how to use this platform.

<div id="Simulation">
<h2>Simulation</h2>

<p>Lets consider the following example of an employee database consisting of an employee, their skill, location and age.</p>

{{{id=1|
table = """ Employee   Skill   Location Age """
primary_key = """ Employee Skill """
Dependencies = [ 
                 'Employee : Location', 
                 'Employee : Age'
               ]
///
}}}

<p>After converting this table into Second normal form, the result would be as follows:</p>

{{{id=3|
import re
def convertTo2NF():
    tokens = re.split("\s+",table.strip())
    pkeys = re.split("\s+",primary_key.strip())

    pkey_grouping = {}
    for pkey in pkeys:
            pkey_grouping.update({pkey:[]})

    for dep in Dependencies:
            rel = dep.split(" : ")
            pkey_grouping[rel[0]].append(rel[1])
            if rel[1] in tokens: tokens.remove(rel[1])

    for pkey_group in pkey_grouping:
            if len(pkey_grouping[pkey_group]) != 0:
                    print pkey_group,
                    for item in pkey_grouping[pkey_group]:
                            print item,
                    print ''

    for token in tokens:
            print token,
convertTo2NF()
///
Employee Location Age 
Employee Skill
}}}
